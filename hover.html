            <p class="t1">  Did you know that food
                does more than just give you energy

    It has been proven that food also has an impact on the  overall health of your vagina and can contribute to infections, odour, and other 
    problems. When we eat certain foods, we usually consider what is good for our bodies 
    or our energy levels, but we rarely 
    choose a meal based on what it might do to our vaginal health.

        <h2 class="text1">1. OKRA</h2>
        <P class="o">The best-kept vaginal secret is okra. Okra contains a lot of
            estrogens which is known to prevent vaginal dryness and 
            atrophy. If you consume okra, the 
            inside of your vaginal will become as wet and 
            slippery as the vegetables.</P>

        <h2 class="text2 ">2. APPLE</h2>
        <P class="a1">
            According to a 2014 study reported by Healthline, 
            women who eat an apple at least once a day had increased 
            sex drive. The Phytoestrogen phloridzin found in apples is
             thought to improve sex functionality, lubrication, arousal,
              and orgasmic ability.
        </P>
        <P class="a2">
            Scientists also believe that the compound
             phloridzin found in apples is similar to the female
              sex hormone oestradiol. This hormone is important 
              in sexual arousal.
        </P>
        <P class="a3">
            Apples also contain antioxidants that help stimulate blood flow to the vagina. 
            This causes the body to feel intimate pleasure and, 
            eventually, orgasm.
        </P>

        <h2 class="text3">3. ORANGE</h2>
        <p class="o1">
            Orange is one of the most popular fruits; it
             is high in vitamin C, which is known to have 
             numerous health benefits. This includes, among other 
             things, preventing skin damage, lowering cholesterol,
              controlling blood sugar levels, and keeping the vagina 
              lubricated.
